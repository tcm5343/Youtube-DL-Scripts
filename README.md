# youtube-dl scripts
These are scripts which I use to download youtube videos. The youtube-dl scripts themselves are based off of https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/c6fh4x/after_hoarding_over_50k_youtube_videos_here_is/. 

# archiveScript
The archive log is a script I wrote in python which is meant to be executed in the root of your youtube-dl directory. It generates a new archive.log file in your root directory based off of the file which are currently in your directory. This keeps your archive.log up to date with what is actually on your machine.
